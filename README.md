# Kaggle-Two-Sigma-Renthop-challenge

### Data Description

In this competition, I predict how popular an apartment rental listing is based on the listing content like text description, photos, number of bedrooms, price, etc. The data comes from renthop.com, an apartment listing website. These apartments are located in New York City.

The target variable, interest_level, is defined by the number of inquiries a listing has in the duration that the listing was live on the site.
